# Restaurant Recommendation System

A recommendation model built in python which recommends restaurants to user based on their preferences.

 - welcome.py : has the welcome screen printed out
 - data.py : has the data of the restaurants and different kinds of food
 - linkedlist.py : has the implementation code of linkedlist
 - node.py : node file
 - script.py :  has the main implementation algorithm

The user can type in the food they prefer and the restaurants with that specific food type
are returned.  

Once the user can see the relevant data like address and rating of the restaurant, the user can either quit the application or look for another restaurant in different food types.
