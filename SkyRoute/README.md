# SkyRoute: Graph Search Program

## Files
#### graph_search.py has the bfs() and dfs() functions implemented in Python
#### vc_metro.py contains a graph of all stations in the Vancouver metro system
#### vc_landmarks.py contains a dictionary of Vancouver landmarks mapped to their nearest metro station(s)
#### landmark_choices.py contains a dictionary of letters of the alphabet mapped to landmarks to make it easier for users to make a selection

## Description
#### This project uses the concepts of BFS and DFS Graph search to find the shortest and best route between the starting and final point  
#### User gets to choose the stations from 26 mentioned stations present in Vancouver  
#### Once the result is given, user gets to see any other shortest routes (to find the shortest routes, BFS is used).  

## Extras
#### Extra Feature: Added a feature to choose another shortest route if a current station is under construction.
